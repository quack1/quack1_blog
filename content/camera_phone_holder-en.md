Summary: #DIY project where I made a simple holder to hang my phone "GoPro style" to film without keeping it in my hand.
Lang: en

Since I still don't own a GoPro, I record the [few videos I made](/tag/my-videos.html "Tag - My Videos") with my phone. But I needed a kind of tripod tool to hang it and simply choose the right point of view without keeping it in my hand.

So I made a _quick and dirty_ thing based on a pocket camera tripod, a mobile phone case and a C-clamp. The hole thing costs me around 20â‚¬.

_I found this idea somewhere on the Internet but I can't remember where. When I find it I'll add it here._

After finishing this video I found a second method to do this that is simpler and works with every model of phone. If I need to do a second one I think I'll use [this system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EjGUXVyTzY).
